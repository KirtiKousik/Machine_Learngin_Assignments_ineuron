        "- __F-measurement:__\n",
        "The F-measure is a metric commonly used in binary classification tasks. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and is a way of balancing the trade-off between these two metrics. F-measure is calculated as (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall), where precision is the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions, and recall is the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of actual positives.\n",

        "- __The Width of the Silhouette:__\n",
        "The silhouette score is a metric used to assess the quality of clustering results. It measures how well each data point fits within its assigned cluster compared to other clusters. The silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better clustering. The width of the silhouette refers to the thickness of the silhouette plot, which is a visualization of the silhouette score for each data point. A thicker silhouette plot indicates that the clusters are well-separated and distinct.\n",

        "- __Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve:__\n",
        "The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classification model. It plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) at different classification thresholds. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a common metric used to compare the performance of different classification models. AUC values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance."
