        "- If a machine learning model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations, it is likely suffering from overfitting. There are several approaches to addressing overfitting, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Simplifying the model: One approach to reducing overfitting is to simplify the model by reducing the number of features, reducing the number of hidden layers in a neural network, or using a simpler model architecture. This can help to reduce the complexity of the model, making it less likely to overfit the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Regularization: Another approach to reducing overfitting is to use regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, which add a penalty term to the loss function that the model is optimizing. This penalty term discourages the model from fitting the training data too closely, helping to reduce overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique that involves dividing the data into multiple folds, training the model on different folds and evaluating its performance on the remaining fold. This allows for a more robust assessment of the model's ability to generalize to new data, and can help to identify if the model is overfitting the training data."
