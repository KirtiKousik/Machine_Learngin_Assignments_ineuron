This approach is computationally efficient, but it may not always result in the best possible feature subset.\n",

The goal is to select features with the highest scores, which are deemed to be the most informative. Filter methods are computationally efficient and do not require the use of a learning algorithm. However, they may not always lead to the best feature subset for the learning algorithm.\n",
